# foundations-auth-proxy

### Setup
By default the server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:3333`. This can be edited in `__main__.py` in the `app.run(...)` function.

You may also have to configure `proxy_config.yaml` with the proper `service_uri` information.

### Running locally
Run `python -m auth_proxy` from the project root directory.

### Running in Docker
Coming soon...
